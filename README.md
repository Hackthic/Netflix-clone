# Netflix-clone
Hey, This is the simple Netflix website clone. 
How I Start it:- 
first of all, I download all the images and the video running on the website which is part of UI/UX;
second I start making the basic structure of the page and then I used the CSS for the coloring.

the technology used:- 
1. HTML
2. CSS
   AIM: As i learn more technology related to the web development i will implement on this clone project and make it better.
